    Personal Statement
    </h2>

    <p>
        
        I am a reliable student that works hard both in and out of the workplace. Although academically I excel in mathematics and physics, I also have a strong foreign language skill set of which has further been developed over the course of a short-term French exchange. Furthermore, this experience massively enhanced my confidence and communication skills as I was required to step outside of my comfort zone. My time at university has allowed me to gain a higher level of independence as well as aiding in improving my time management skills, including teaching me how to best prioritise tasks. Having a background in mathematics has assisted greatly in developing my problem-solving skills and also demonstrates that I carry out tasks in a logical way. Completing my Food preparation and nutrition GCSE taught me the importance of organisation in the kitchen, but a skill which is necessary in daily life too nonetheless. In addition to this, during my job at a nursery it was imperative that I was able to multi task, hence why organisational skills proved important. Working in a café taught me how to work under pressure in a fast-paced environment, as well as being a ‘learn on the go’ job whereby I had to adapt to many different roles as detailed below.
